# Kicktarter-Projects-Classification
This is a Multi-class classification project on the kickstarter projects data

## 1. Introduction
The dataset can be found in the url https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kemical/kickstarter-projects . 
Kickstarter is a platform launched in 2009 for the purpose of supporting the projects that are looking for some funding from people who are willing to back the projects with real good intent, potential and innovation. Ever since it is launched, the platform has been a huge success with over 113 projects being funded successfully along with 24 thousand backings and in total 2.4 million dollars funded. The projects that are looking for a funding are listed on the platform with the complete details like the specifications of the product, how it is different from the existing similar projects in the market, uses of the project and how are they going to reward the backers of the project etc. The project must be listed with a deadline to close the funding and a target amount that is needed for the project to go-live. The Kickstarter platforms in a way of all-or-nothing approach, which means, a project gets the funding only if it can reach the target amount within the target deadline. Else, the projects become failed and receives nothing in funding and the backers will be refunded their contribution.
Two versions of the dataset are available at the source. For the purpose of this assignment/coursework, I have taken only the 2018 version of the dataset as it is an extended version of the 2016 version. The dataset consists of the following columns.

### 1.1 Research Question:
Given the data of all the projects that were listed since the inception of Kickstarter platform, can we model the data and predict the state of the project (eg. successful, failure, cancelled, suspended)?
